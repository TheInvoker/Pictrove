# Pictrove

Introducing Pictrove: a new way to share authentic images and experiences with your friends and family. Picture a social media platform where filters are discouraged and the first image you take is good enough. You never have to worry if something is "share worthy" and you can gain insight on the daily lives of your friends and people who interest you with fun categories like "Lunch Adventures," "Morning Routine" or "Made my Day." Remove the pressure of gaining more likes or followers. Take one shot, live in the moment, and make social media authentic again.
